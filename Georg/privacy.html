        <li>Performance metrics</li>
        <li>Error reports</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the Georg Application's functionality</li>
        <li>To enable you to register, track, and resolve customer complaints and claims</li>

        <li>To provide technical support and troubleshoot issues</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Storage and Processing</h2>
    <p>All customer data is stored and processed within your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central environment. We do not extract or store your data on our servers unless specifically authorized for troubleshooting or support purposes. The Georg Application operates entirely within your Business Central instance, utilizing Microsoft's secure infrastructure for data storage.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your information with third parties. We may share information under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With Microsoft as the platform provider for Business Central</li>
        <li>With our authorized service providers who help us operate, maintain, and support the Application</li>
        <li>When required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order</li>
        <li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of Metadata ehf, our customers, or others</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These security measures include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Leveraging Microsoft's secure Business Central platform</li>
        <li>Digital signing of our application files</li>
        <li>Implementation of permission sets to control access to data</li>
        <li>Regular security assessments and updates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Customer data is retained within your Business Central environment according to your organization's data retention policies. The Georg Application does not implement separate data retention periods outside of your Business Central settings.</p>

For information about Business Central's compliance with international data transfer regulations, please refer to Microsoft's privacy policies.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Statement</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will post the revised statement on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this statement periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
